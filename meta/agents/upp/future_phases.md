## Phase 4: Self-Improvement Loop (Tentative)

**Estimated Timeline:** Jan-Feb 2026  
**Status:** PLANNED  
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 validation data, performance baselines, quality metrics

### Tentative Objectives

1. **Agent Self-Optimization**
   - Agents propose and implement their own performance improvements
   - Automated refactoring suggestions based on code patterns
   - Self-tuning of workflow parameters

2. **Automated Architectural Drift Detection**
   - Continuous monitoring for tier boundary violations
   - Pattern deviation alerts
   - Automated architectural compliance reporting

3. **Self-Documenting Code Generation**
   - Code generation includes comprehensive documentation
   - Automated API reference updates
   - Generated code explains its own architecture

4. **Agent Performance Benchmarking**
   - Metrics collection for each agent's efficiency
   - Comparative analysis across sessions
   - Optimization recommendations based on data

### Success Criteria (Preliminary)
- ✅ Agents autonomously propose ≥5 valid optimizations
- ✅ Drift detection catches 100% of architectural violations
- ✅ Generated code includes inline architecture explanations
- ✅ Agent performance improved by ≥20% from baseline

### Open Questions
- How much autonomy should agents have in self-modification?
- What guardrails prevent agents from breaking architecture?
- How to balance innovation with stability?

## Phase 5: Multi-Project Support (Tentative)

**Estimated Timeline:** Mar-Apr 2026  
**Status:** CONCEPTUAL  
**Dependencies:** Phase 4 stability, proven agent autonomy

### Tentative Objectives

1. **Extend DevStudio for Multiple Codebases**
   - Support managing 2+ distinct projects simultaneously
   - Isolated contexts per project
   - Shared agent infrastructure

2. **Cross-Project Knowledge Sharing**
   - Learn patterns from one project, apply to others
   - Shared dependency management
   - Common architectural patterns library

3. **Project Isolation & Security**
   - PermissionFilter extensions for multi-project
   - Project-specific credential management
   - Audit trail per project

4. **Unified Observability**
   - Single dashboard for all managed projects
   - Cross-project performance comparisons
   - Resource allocation optimization

### Success Criteria (Preliminary)
- ✅ Successfully manage ≥2 distinct projects
- ✅ Zero cross-project permission violations
- ✅ Shared learnings reduce implementation time by ≥30%
- ✅ Unified observability covers all projects

### Open Questions
- How to prevent context bleed between projects?
- Should agents be project-specific or shared?
- Resource limits per project?
