## ADR-001: Hierarchical Agent System (Phase 1)

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED  
**Deciders:** Project Lead

### Context

Initial requirement was to build a coding assistant. Two approaches considered:
1. Single monolithic agent (like existing assistants)
2. Hierarchical multi-agent system with specialized roles

### Decision

Adopted 4-tier hierarchical architecture:
- **Tier 1:** Liaison (user interface, intent filtering)
- **Tier 2:** Project Lead (orchestration, planning)
- **Tier 3:** Domain Leads (specialized domains: Dev, QA, Docs)
- **Tier 4:** Executors (atomic task execution)

### Consequences

**✅ Benefits:**
- Separation of concerns prevents cognitive overload
- Auditable decision chain (all escalations logged)
- Scalable (add new domain leads without refactoring)
- Resilient (checkpoints enable resume after human intervention)

**⚠️ Trade-offs:**
- More complex than single agent
- Increased inter-agent communication overhead
- Requires workflow orchestration (MAF SDK)

---

## ADR-002: Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF SDK) (Phase 1)

**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED  
**Deciders:** Project Lead

### Context

Needed a framework to support hierarchical agents with durable workflows. Options:
1. Build custom workflow engine
2. Use LangGraph
3. Use Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF SDK)

### Decision

Selected MAF SDK for enterprise-grade workflow orchestration.

### Rationale

- **Checkpointing:** Built-in workflow persistence (resume after failures)
- **Type Safety:** Enforces type hints for tool calling and message passing
- **Enterprise Features:** Unified identity, governance, telemetry
- **Pluggable:** Context Providers, CheckpointStorage, AgentThreads

### Consequences

**✅ Benefits:**
- Workflow durability out-of-the-box
- Enterprise deployment path
- Strong architectural patterns (prevents drift)

**⚠️ Trade-offs:**
- Learning curve for MAF SDK patterns
- Must adhere to MAF SDK standards (Context Providers, WorkflowBuilder)

---

## ADR-003: FOSS-First Philosophy (Phase 0)

**Date:** 2025-09-15  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED  
**Deciders:** Project Lead

### Context

LLM hosting options:
1. Cloud-only (OpenAI, Anthropic)
2. Local-only (Ollama)
3. Hybrid (local primary, cloud fallback)

### Decision

Hybrid approach: **Ollama (local) primary, Gemini 2.0 Flash (cloud) fallback** via LiteLLM Proxy.

### Rationale

- **Privacy:** Local models = zero data leakage
- **Cost:** Local inference = $0 per request
- **Reliability:** Cloud fallback ensures uptime
- **Performance:** GPU-accelerated Ollama for low latency

### Consequences

**✅ Benefits:**
- No API costs for routine tasks
- Full control over model versions
- Works offline (with degraded functionality)

**⚠️ Trade-offs:**
- Requires GPU (NVIDIA, 8GB+ VRAM)
- Local model capability < GPT-4 class
- Increased infrastructure complexity (Docker services)

## ADR-004: PostgreSQL + ChromaDB Dual Persistence (Phase 2-4)

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED  
**Deciders:** Project Lead

### Context

Need both structured (audit logs, governance) and unstructured (RAG knowledge) persistence.

### Decision

- **PostgreSQL:** Audit logs, checkpoints, agent metadata, drift detection
- **ChromaDB:** Vector embeddings for RAG (project context, documentation)

### Rationale

- PostgreSQL: ACID guarantees for governance
- ChromaDB: Optimized for semantic search
- Both lightweight and FOSS

### Consequences

**✅ Benefits:**
- Right tool for each job
- Both integrate with MAF SDK (CheckpointStorage, Context Providers)

**⚠️ Trade-offs:**
- Two databases to maintain
- Coordination required for cross-database queries (future)

---

## ADR-005: Streamlit + Next.js Dual UI (Phase 8)

**Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED  
**Deciders:** Project Lead

### Context

UI requirements:
1. **Liaison home base:** Simple chat interface
2. **Agent graph visualization:** Real-time activity monitoring

### Decision

- **Streamlit (`:8501`):** Chat interface (rapid prototyping, Python-native)
- **Next.js (`:3000`):** Agent graph with React Flow (rich interactivity)

### Rationale

- Streamlit = fastest path for chat UI
- Next.js = best library support for graph visualization (React Flow)
- Both share same FastAPI backend (`/api/agent_api.py`)

### Consequences

**✅ Benefits:**
- Right UI framework for each use case
- Shared backend reduces duplication

**⚠️ Trade-offs:**
- Two frontend codebases to maintain
- State synchronization complexity

##ADR-006: Phase 10 Multi-Project Pivot (Principle of Least Authority)

**Date:** 2025-11-20  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED  
**Deciders:** Project Lead, Human

### Context

Original vision: DevStudio modifies its own source code.  
**Problem:** Agents with write access to their own source = catastrophic risk (self-modification, deletion).

### Decision

**Architectural Pivot:** Transform DevStudio from self-modifying to **multi-project IDE backend**.

**Key Changes:**
1. **Read-only source mount:** DevStudio source code mounted read-only in Docker
2. **Workspaces directory:** Projects live in `/workspaces/{project_id}/`
3. **Project isolation:** Each project gets scoped database (project_id), isolated ChromaDB collection
4. **Principle of Least Authority (PoLA):** Agents only access tools they need, projects they're assigned to

### Rationale

- **Security:** Prevents accidental or malicious self-modification
- **Scalability:** Manage multiple client projects, not just DevStudio itself
- **Enterprise-ready:** Aligns with MAF SDK's multi-tenant patterns
- **Audit-friendly:** Clear separation between system code and project artifacts

### Consequences

**✅ Benefits:**
- Eliminates catastrophic failure mode
- Enables commercial use (service multiple projects)
- Cleaner testing (DevStudio code stable, projects ephemeral)

**⚠️ Trade-offs:**
- Complexity increase (project registry, session management)
- Requires FileTreeReader tool for project context injection
- read-only mount = no self-upgrade path (requires manual rebuild)

**Implementation:** Phase 10 (blocked on MAF SDK compliance)

---

## ADR-007: Documentation Architecture (CURRENT + ARCHIVE Pattern)

**Date:** 2025-11-21  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED  
**Deciders:** Project Lead, Human

### Context

Documentation proliferation issues:
- Inconsistent patterns (some categories had CURRENT/ARCHIVE, others didn't)
- Redundancy (`tutorials/` vs `how-to/`)
- Unclear relationships (vision vs planning vs roadmap)
- Messy `.ai/` folder (7 files, inconsistent naming)

### Decision

Apply **universal CURRENT + ARCHIVE pattern** across all temporal documentation:

**Temporal (2-file pattern):**
- `planning/CURRENT.md` + `planning/ARCHIVE.md`
- `feedback/CURRENT.md` + `feedback/ARCHIVE.md`
- `architecture/CURRENT.md` + `architecture/DECISIONS.md` (this file)

**Reference (single-file pattern):**
- `why/RATIONALE.md` (all "why" questions)
- `vision/FUTURE.md` (all aspirations)
- `research/INDEX.md` (catalog of research docs)

**Consolidations:**
- `.ai/`: 7 files → 3 files (MANIFEST.yaml, GUIDELINES.md, AGENTS.md)
- `tutorials/` + `how-to/` → `guides/`
- `explanation/` → `why/`

### Rationale

- **DRY Principle:** Eliminate redundant directories
- **Agent Navigation:** Clear patterns (`planning/CURRENT.md` = always what's happening now)
- **Temporal Clarity:** CURRENT vs ARCHIVE prevents file proliferation
- **Scalability:** Pattern applies to any new documentation category

### Consequences

**✅ Benefits:**
- Agents know exactly where to look
- Prevents documentation sprawl
- Clear migration path (CURRENT → summarize → ARCHIVE)
- Reusable template for future projects

**⚠️ Trade-offs:**
- Large initial migration (16+ files affected)
- Requires discipline to maintain patterns

## ADR-008: Emergency Refactor - MVP-First Approach (Phase 0 Reset)

**Date:** 2025-11-22  
**Status:** ⚡ ACCEPTED (CRITICAL)  
**Deciders:** Expert Systems Review, Project Lead

### Context

Expert systems engineering assessment (Google/Microsoft-tier) identified critical strategic failure:

**Problem:** "Architecture Astronaut Trap" - built elaborate 4-tier agent hierarchy before proving core execution layer works.

**Evidence:**
- `litellm_client.py` cannot parse tool calls (blocks ALL tool usage)
- `code_tools.py` lacks `write_file` implementation (system cannot generate files)
- `communication_tools.py` has empty stubs (delegation non-functional)
- Beautiful class hierarchy exists, but execution layer is broken

**Assessment Verdict:** "7/10 project with potential to be 9/10, but currently a beautiful architecture with no working implementation."

### Decision

**STOP all feature development.** Execute emergency refactor with MVP-first approach:

**Week 1: Emergency Fixes**
1. Fix LLM adapter tool calling (blocks everything)
2. Implement sandboxed file I/O (security-critical)
3. Prove ONE end-to-end flow works
4. Integration tests

**Week 2: Simplification**
- Delete unused agents (keep Liaison + ProjectLead only)
- Remove GovernanceAgent, ArtifactManager (premature optimization)
- Remove WorkflowBuilder temporarily (add back post-MVP)
- Prove simple delegation works

**Week 3: Ship MVP**
- ONE working flow: User → Liaison → ProjectLead → FileWriter → Disk
- **Ship it**, then iterate

**Week 4+: Rebuild Incrementally**
- Add complexity back with tests at each step
- DomainLeads → WorkflowBuilder → Executors → Governance

### Rationale

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Fell into pattern common among smart engineers:
1. Clear vision of end state
2. Enjoy designing elegant systems  
3. Comfortable with abstraction
4. **Underestimate implementation complexity**

**Result:** Documented ideal state before proving implementation feasible.

**Senior Engineering Pattern (violated):**
1. Spike/prototype core execution path ❌
2. Prove it works end-to-end ❌
3. Scale horizontally (add features)
4. Document what you built (not what you wish you built)

**We did this backwards.**

**Key Principle:** "Complexity is the enemy of working software" - prove minimal system works, then scale up.

### Consequences

**✅ Benefits:**
- Focus on execution layer (what actually matters)
- Tests prevent regression as complexity returns
- Working MVP demonstrates value immediately
- Reduces technical debt accumulation
- Forces documentation to match reality

**⚠️ Trade-offs:**
- Throw away some elegant design temporarily
- Admitted failure of initial approach (ego hit)
- Restart mid-project (morale risk)
- Short-term: less impressive, long-term: actually works

**🔴 Critical Requirements:**
- No `exec()` without sandboxing (RCE vulnerability)
- No blocking I/O in async contexts (architectural violation)
- All code changes test-driven from this point forward
- Documentation updated to match implementation (not aspirations)

- See `feedback/CURRENT.md` - Expert Systems Engineering Assessment (full analysis)
- See `planning/CURRENT.md` - Emergency Refactor integrated into current phase priorities
