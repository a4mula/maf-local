# Current Phase: Phase 3 - Full-Stack Validation

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-25
**Status:** 🚧 **PHASE 3 IN PROGRESS - WEEK 1 COMPLETE**

---

## Overview

We are currently executing **Phase 2** of the Unified Batching Engine (UBE) architecture plan. The goal is to expand the simplified 2-tier MVP into a robust 4-tier hierarchy with strict separation of concerns, mediated by batching workflows.

**Current State:**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Foundations Complete:** ProjectLeadAgent inheritance fixed, DocumentationAgent created, PermissionFilter implemented.
- ✅ **Tool System Refactored:** All tools converted to pure MAF `@ai_function` with Pydantic models. `UniversalTool` registry removed.
- ✅ **Executor Tier Implemented:** `BaseExecutor`, `CoderExecutor`, `TesterExecutor`, `WriterExecutor` created and tested (8/8 tests pass).
- ✅ **TLB Workflow Implemented:** `TLBWorkflow` created for parallel executor execution and report aggregation (7/7 tests pass).
- ✅ **Regression Testing:** All Phase 1 tests (29/29) still passing. Total test count: 44/44.

**Previous Issues (NOW RESOLVED):**
- ✅ `UniversalTool` technical debt eliminated.
- ✅ `ProjectLeadAgent` inheritance fixed (proper `ChatAgent` subclass).
- ✅ `PermissionFilter` implemented as true MAF `FunctionMiddleware`.
- ✅ Data contracts (`ExecutorReport`, `StrategicPlan`) defined and enforced.

## Current Architecture (Phase 2 Status)

### Agent Hierarchy (Target State)
```
User
  ↓
LiaisonAgent (Tier 1) - Intent Classification
  ↓
ProjectLeadAgent (Tier 2) ↔ DocumentationAgent (Tier 2 Peer)
  ↓ (StrategicPlan via OLB)
Domain Leads (Tier 3) - Dev, QA, Docs
  ↓ (Task Breakdown via TLB)
Executors (Tier 4) - Coder, Tester, Writer
```

### Implementation Status

#### Tier 1: Interface
- **LiaisonAgent:** ✅ Operational (MVP)

#### Tier 2: Orchestration
- **ProjectLeadAgent:** ✅ Operational (MAF-compliant, uses `ALL_TOOLS`)
- **DocumentationAgent:** ✅ Operational (Knowledge Gate, PoLA Gatekeeper)

#### Tier 3: Tactical (Domain Leads)
- **DevDomainLead:** 🚧 Planned (Next Step)
- **QADomainLead:** 🚧 Planned
- **DocsDomainLead:** 🚧 Planned

#### Tier 4: Execution
- **CoderExecutor:** ✅ Operational (Atomic execution, `execute_code` tool)
- **TesterExecutor:** ✅ Operational (Atomic execution, `execute_code` tool)
- **WriterExecutor:** ✅ Operational (Atomic execution, no tools)

#### Workflows (Batchers)
- **TLB (Tactical Level Batcher):** ✅ Implemented (MVP sequential execution, report aggregation)
- **OLB (Orchestration Level Batcher):** 🚧 Planned (Step 8)

## Recent Achievements (Nov 24, 2025)

### 1. Tool System Refactor ✅
- **Problem:** `UniversalTool` wrapper was unnecessary technical debt.
- **Solution:** Converted all tools to native MAF `@ai_function` with Pydantic input models.
- **Result:** Cleaner code, better type safety, full MAF compliance.

### 2. Executor Tier Implementation ✅
- **Problem:** No specialized agents for atomic tasks.
- **Solution:** Created `BaseExecutor` and concrete implementations (`Coder`, `Tester`, `Writer`).
- **Result:** Executors produce structured `ExecutorReport` objects and escalate ambiguity.

### 3. TLB Workflow ✅
- **Problem:** No mechanism to manage parallel execution.
- **Solution:** Created `TLBWorkflow` to orchestrate executors and aggregate results.
- **Result:** 7/7 tests passing for task execution and aggregation.

## Next Steps (Phase 2 Roadmap)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Immediate Focus:** Implementing the Domain Lead tier to bridge the gap between Project Lead and Executors.

### Step 6: Domain Lead Agents (Next)
- Create `src/agents/domain_leads/`
- Implement `BaseDomainLead` class
- Implement `DevDomainLead`
- Integrate with TLB workflow

### Step 7: Domain Lead Tests
- Test DL → TLB → Executor flow
- Test task breakdown logic

### Step 8: OLB Workflow
- Implement `OLBWorkflow` using MAF `SwitchCaseEdgeGroup`
- Route `StrategicPlan` to correct Domain Leads

### Step 9: Full Integration
- Update `ProjectLeadAgent` to output `StrategicPlan`
- Connect PL → OLB → DL → TLB → Executor

## Phase 3: Full-Stack Validation (Current)

### Week 1: Validation Infrastructure (Completed)
- ✅ **E2E Test Harness:** `tests/integration/test_e2e_workflows.py` created.
- ✅ **Observability:** `workflow_metrics.py` implemented.
- ✅ **Compliance:** `verify_maf_compliance.py` created (34 violations found).

### Week 2: System Audit & Repair (Planned)
- [ ] **Critical Fix:** Implement `QADomainLead` (Missing from codebase).
- [ ] **Compliance:** Fix 34 `print()` violations.
- [ ] **Refactor:** Improve `LiaisonAgent` testability.
- [ ] **Audit:** API Reference Review.
